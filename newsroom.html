    <h2> Bihar Flood</h2>
    <p>Repeated floods have led to thousands of people in north Bihar districts to live amid floodwater since June while their houses and croplands lie damaged.

      There is little chance of water receding from these villages along the Nepal border; the India Meteorological Department has predicted more rains in late August and even in September.
      
      The river overflowed and washed away bamboo and mud houses in dozens of villages on its banks. “It is unusual for floodwater to enter villages before water recedes from earlier flooding,” said Md Aslam from Bugladangi village...

    <h2>Kinnaur Landslide</h2>
    <p> Himachal Pradesh suffered a massive landslide August 11, 2021, which killed two persons while dozens were reported missing. The casualty figures could increase.
      A number of battalions of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police were working frantically to locate survivors.
      Chief Minister Jairam Thakur said rescue teams were at work at the landslide site in Kinnaur district’s Nigulsari, trying to pull out survivors from under debris...

    <h2>Odisha cyclone</h2>
    <p> As per the Global Environmental Negotiation journal, if the sea level rises 1 meter from the current level, 1,70,000 hectare of cultivable land in the state is likely to submerge. 
      Let’s go back to 1999 when Odisha faced one of the greatest cyclonic disasters ever recorded – 
      the Super Cyclone also called the 1999 Odisha cyclone. Originating about 550 km east of the Andaman Island,
       it hit the state at a wind speed of approximately 300 kmph and affected 14 coastal districts, 
      28 coastal towns and two major cities of Bhubaneswar and Cuttack. Nearly ten thousand lost their lives in the cyclone, and 13 million were affected by it.

    <h2>Uttrakhand Disaster Prone</h2>
    <p> Long road home: Uttarakhand increasingly declares villages disaster-prone<br>
      While many are fighting relocation, those who shift face conflicts with host villages over resources like water and grazing land. 
      Is relocation the right way to mitigate disasters that are striking the Himalayan state with increasing ferocity?<br>
      On July 18, 2021, when the Chamoli district administration moved the statue of Gaura Devi from Raini village to relatively safer Joshimath town, 25 kilometres downhill,
       it really removed the symbol of a historic event that helped protect the sensitive ecology of upper Himalaya until recently.

    <h2>Maharashtra Flood</h2>
    <p> 
      More than 100 people have lost their lives in rain-related incidents, 99 still missing in Maharashtra till Saturday night, said the Relief and Rehabilitation Department. At least 53 people were left injured. Meanwhile, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray visited flood-affected
       Chiplun where he met officials and local representatives to assess the extent of damage and ongoing relief operation.
    Kolhapur has been the worst hit with almost all its main roads including the Pune-Bengaluru highway being blocked due to overflowing waters from the Panchganga River. Locals said the situation was worse than in 2019 when the entire Kolhapur was under water for more than a week.
